<h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>

<ol>
    <li>Slice bacon into 1-2" pieces, place into large Dutch Oven 
    or soup pot over medium heat and cook until bacon is crisp and browned.</li>
    <li>Remove bacon and set aside, leaving the fat in the pot.</li>
    <li>Add butter and chopped onion to fat and cook over medium heat until
    onions are translucent and tender (3-5 minutes)</li>
    <li>Add garlic and cook until fragrant (about 30 seconds)</li>
    <li>Sprinkle the flour over the ingredients in the pot and stir
    until smooth(use whisk if needed)</li>
    <li>Add diced potatoes to the pot along with chicken broth, milk
    heavy cream, ancho chili powder, and salt and pepper to taste. Stir well.</li>
    <li>Bring to a boil and cook until potatoes are tender 
        when pierced with a fork (about 10 minutes)</li>
    <li>Reduce heat to simmer and blend about half the soup (about 5 cups)
